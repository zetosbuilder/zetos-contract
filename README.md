### About Our Project

Zetos Share (ZES) will be developed based on BNB Chain in the early stage and will develop cross-chain algorithm stable currency in the later stages, and gradually expand to other chains and platforms such as APTOS.

Now deployed ZES,ZEC,ZEB Token to BSC Mainnet,
And our website is ready, view [https://zetos.finance](https://zetos.finance) for more.

### Zetos Cash Algorithm


Zetos Cash uses an "algorithmic central bank" that manages the token supply according to predetermined logic. The algorithm is responsible for balancing the supply and fluctuating demand of stablecoins, ensuring that token prices remain relatively stable.

When the price of Zetos Cash (ZEC) is less than $1, it is necessary to reduce the circulation of Zetos Cash (ZEC) so that the price of Zetos Cash (ZEC) will naturally rise to 1 USD.

The price of Zetos Cash (ZEC) is less than 1 USD, and users can purchase bonds Zetos Bond (ZEB) by burning Zetos Cash (ZEC) to get Zetos Bond (ZEB).

Zetos Bond (ZEB) price = the square of the price of Zetos Cash (ZEC), because the price of Zetos Cash (ZEC) is less than 1, so the price of the squared Zetos Bond (ZEB) will be lower, and a Zetos Bond (ZEB) can be used in the future Exchange it back for one Zetos Cash (ZEC)  
When the price of Zetos Cash (ZEC) exceeds 1 USD, it is necessary to increase the circulation of Zetos Cash (ZEC) so that the price of Zetos Cash (ZEC) will naturally drop to 1 USD.

The current threshold is that when Zetos Cash (ZEC) > 1.05, it can trigger The system issues additional Zetos Cash (ZEC), and the additional Zetos Cash (ZEC) will be issued to users who hold Zetos Band (ZEB) and Zetos Share (ZES) to pay off their debts first, so the users who hold Zetos Band (ZEB) will be given first.

It is to destroy Zetos Bond (ZEB) and get the remaining Zetos Cash (ZEC) from Zetos Cash (ZEC) to Zetos Share (ZES) holders. If there is no remaining, Zetos Share (ZES) holders will not be allocated Zetos Share (ZES) is equivalent to a shareholder, only the Zetos Share (ZES) locked into the boardroom contract can get this part of the income.
